# Manual testing

Hello, thank you for thinking about contributing to Arroost!

Arroost is in a very early stage, and you can't do much (yet).<br>
However, some things can still be tested already!

---

Below are some very basic tests you could try out, if you want to help.<br>
Please only do so if it's something you might enjoy, or find interesting :)

It's really helpful if you tell me your browser and operating system too!

**Note:** I'm not actively working on touch controls, so some functionality is missing (eg: pinch zooming). However, I don't want it to get completely broken! I've fixed a few crashes with it already.


## Camera controls

* Can you move around the camera?
* Can you zoom in and out?
* How does it feel?

## Carrying

When you load, there's a circle on the screen.
* Can you pick it up?
* Can you throw it around?
* How does it feel to move it around?

## Clicking

When you load, there's a circle on the screen.

* Can you click it?
* Does it spawn smaller circles?
* How does it feel?

## Targeting

When you spawn enough circles, a "plus" circle should spawn.

* Can you click it?
* Does a line come out of it when you do?
* Does the line disappear when you click again?
