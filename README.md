# Arroost

Arroost is a ridiculous music-making tool.

I'm making it for the next youtube video on [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TodePond) called ðŸŽµ **Arrows in Arrows in Arrows**.

## What's the big idea?

Arroost is a mad all-star mix of big ideas from my previous projects:

-  [visual programming language](https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond)
-  [cellular automata](https://github.com/TodePond/SandPond)
-  [time travel](https://github.com/TodePond/TimePond)
-  [fractals](https://github.com/TodePond/ScreenPond)

## How can I use it?

It's not ready yet!<br>
But when it is, it'll be up at [arroost.com](https://arroost.com).

## How can I help develop it?

To run it locally, clone this repo, then run a local file server.<br>
I recommend installing [deno](https://deno.com/runtime)'s [file server](https://deno.com/manual@v1.13.2/examples/file_server):

```
deno install --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts
```

Then run it with:

```
file_server .
```

To run the tests, run:

```
deno test --watch .
```

## How does it all work?

It's a secret.
